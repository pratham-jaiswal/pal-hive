# Contributing to Pal Hive
First off, thank you for considering contributing to Pal Hive.


## Where do I go from here?
If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make sure to check our [issues](https://github.com/pratham-jaiswal/pal-hive/issues) if there's something similar to what you've observed or want to suggest. If there isn't, feel free to open a new issue!


## Fork & create a branch
If this is something you think you can fix, then fork the repository and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #2 is the ticket you're working on):

```bash
git checkout -b feature/2-create-new-post
```
